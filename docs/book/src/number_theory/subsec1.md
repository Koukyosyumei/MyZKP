## Computation Rule and Properties


### Definition: Binary Operation

---

*A mapping \\(\circ: X \times X \rightarrow X\\) is a binary operation on \\(X\\) if for any pair of elements \\((x_1, x_2)\\) in \\(X\\), \\(x_1 \circ x_2\\) is also in \\(X\\).*

---

**Example**: Addition (+) on the set of integers is a binary operation. For example, \\(5 + 3 = 8\\), and both \\(5, 3, 8\\) are integers, staying within the set of integers.

### Definition: Associative Property

---

*A binary operation \\(\circ\\) is associative if \\((a \circ b) \circ c = a \circ (b \circ c)\\) for all \\(a, b, c \in X\\).*

---

**Example**: Multiplication of real numbers is associative: \\((2 \times 3) \times 4 = 2 \times (3 \times 4) = 24\\). In a modular context, we also have addition modulo \\(n\\) being associative. For example, for \\(n = 5\\), \\((2 + 3) \bmod 5 + 4 \bmod 5 = 2 + (3 \bmod 5 + 4) \bmod 5 = 4\\).

### Definition: Commutative Property

---

*A binary operation \\(\circ\\) is commutative if \\(a \circ b = b \circ a\\) for all \\(a, b \in X\\).*

---

**Example**: Addition modulo \\(n\\) is also commutative. For \\(n = 7\\), \\(5 + 3 \bmod 7 = 3 + 5 \bmod 7 = 1\\).
