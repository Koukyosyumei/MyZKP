# Basics of Number Theory

To effectively understand and implement ZKP protocols, a solid grasp of number theory concepts is essential. Topics such as rings, groups, fields, modular arithmetic, polynomials, elliptic curves, and pairings are foundational to these protocols.

In this tutorial, we’ll cover these fundamental ideas, highlight their key properties, and demonstrate their implementation from scratch in Rust. 🦀 Whether you're new to these concepts or looking for a refresher, this section will help you build a strong foundation. If you're already an expert, feel free to skip ahead! 🚀
